# File-sharing
The project involves creating a File Sharing Web Application that allows users to upload files and generate unique URLs for those files, enabling other users to download them easily. Below is a detailed description of the project:
Project Overview
Objective
The main goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly web application where users can upload files of various types (e.g., documents, images, videos) and generate shareable URLs. Other users can then use these URLs to download the files directly to their machines.

Key Features

File Upload: Users can select files from their devices and upload them to the server.
URL Generation: Upon successful upload, the application generates a unique URL for each file.
File Download: Other users can access the generated URL to download the file directly.
File Management: Users can view their uploaded files, delete them if necessary, and manage their storage space.

Technical Specifications
Frontend: The user interface will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (possibly with frameworks like React).
Backend: The server-side logic will be built using Node.js with Express.js, handling file uploads and URL generation.
Database: A database (like MongoDB) will be used to store metadata about the uploaded files, including file names, sizes, upload dates, and generated URLs.
File Storage: Files can be stored on the server's filesystem or in a cloud storage solution (like AWS S3) for scalability.

Workflow
Upload Process:
The user selects a file using an upload button on the web interface.
The file is sent to the server via an API endpoint.
The server processes the file and stores it in the designated storage location.
A unique URL is generated for the uploaded file.

Download Process:
The user shares the generated URL with others.
Recipients can paste the URL into their browsers to access the file.
When they hit enter, the browser initiates a download of the file directly from the server.

Conclusion
This File Sharing Web Application aims to simplify file sharing among users by providing a straightforward interface for uploading and downloading files through unique URLs. It combines ease of use with essential security features, making it suitable for both personal and professional use cases.
